You will see a representation of the hangman, the current state of the word you're trying to guess, and the number of chances left. **_(initially you have total 6 chances)_**

Enter a letter as your guess and press Enter.
If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the word. Otherwise, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
